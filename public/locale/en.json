    "The home is beautiful and very clean and well appointed. Loved the nice addition of a speaker. We loved having a big cooler, nice chairs and umbrella. Snorkeling gear was ok, We had some difficulty with a couple of the snorkels not working properly. I enjoyed using the kayaks and paddle boards to see the turtles in the bay and the beach is a short walk from the home. The view is ok, you can see some water from the master bedroom balcony. Close location to Cruz Bay. A great place to stay overall.",
    "Location was 5 minutes away from red hook ferry, making it easy to get to dinner spots and beaches. Villa was brand new with lots of special touches, such as a spice rack, new grill, soft sheets, thick towels, and full sized washer and dryer. The villa was very clean as well.",
    "Nicely appointed. Great location. Nice owners",
    "Wonderful experience. The entire family had a great time. The Tuttle family made our trip over the top for us. The Villa was beautiful with everything and more that you would need. We will be sharing this trip with everyone we know for many years.",
    "Enjoyed it Beautiful place",
    "We really enjoyed our stay at the property. The management team running the property (among others) was very communicative and we really had no problems with getting in / access to information etc. They also offered access to pre-stocking our kitchen, which came in very handy! The island is lovely and we enjoyed having our Jeep to get around to various beaches and this location is very close to Cruz Bay. While the unit was very modern and relatively close to the beach (just as 2 min walk around the building), our only issue with the unit was hot water. We really did not have anything but luke-warm water in the two very nice upstairs bathrooms. We were given the advice to try to run the water longer so that it could heat up, but that never did fix the issue. And we even then had issues with the downstairs bathroom water temperature as well. This would be the reason we did not rate it 5-stars. All in all, very nice stay!"
